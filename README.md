📘 Database Playbook

A practical, community-driven playbook for database operations, reliability, and performance.

Database Playbook is a personal, open, and evolving project created to support DBAs, data engineers, SREs, and infrastructure professionals in their daily work with databases.

This repository gathers real-world scripts, queries, diagnostics, and operational practices used in production environments — not theoretical examples.

The goal is simple:
👉 make database operations safer, clearer, and easier to share.

🎯 Purpose

Databases are at the heart of every system — and yet, much of the operational knowledge around them lives only in people’s heads, private notes, or emergency Slack messages.

This playbook exists to:

Share battle-tested operational scripts

Help during incidents, performance issues, and maintenance

Serve as a learning resource for people growing into DBA / SRE roles

Encourage knowledge sharing across database technologies

Build a practical reference, not just documentation

🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This repository includes scripts and guidance for multiple database engines, such as: PostgreSQL, MySQL / MariaDB, SQL Server, MongoDB, and cloud-managed databases (RDS, Aurora, Redshift, etc.)

Content may include:

🔍 Diagnostics and health checks

🚀 Performance and tuning queries

🔐 Security and permissions audits

🧹 Maintenance (vacuum, reindex, cleanup)

🔄 Replication and high availability checks

🚨 Incident response helpers

📊 Capacity and growth analysis

All scripts are written with production reality in mind.

The structure may evolve as the project grows — flexibility is intentional.

🧪 Philosophy

Practical over theoretical

Readable over clever

Operational over academic

Community over ego

Scripts should be:

Clear

Well-commented

Safe by default

Easy to adapt to different environments

🤝 Contributing

This is a community-friendly project.

You are welcome to contribute by:

Adding new scripts

Improving existing ones

Fixing bugs or edge cases

Sharing best practices

Suggesting structure improvements

If you’re unsure whether something “belongs” here — it probably does 🙂

⚠️ Disclaimer

Always review and test scripts before running them in production

Some queries may require specific permissions

Database versions and environments may behave differently

This repository provides guidance and tools, not guarantees.

🌱 Why This Project Exists

People transitioning into database roles

Professionals working alone or without senior references

Teams building operational maturity around data platforms

Knowledge grows when it’s shared.
