📘 Database Playbook

A collection of practical scripts and operational queries for database professionals.

This is a personal project created to share real-world database knowledge and help DBAs, SREs, and data engineers in their daily work.


🎯 Purpose

Databases are at the heart of every system and yet, much of the operational knowledge around them lives only in people’s heads, private notes, or emergency Slack messages.

This playbook exists to:

- Share battle-tested operational scripts;

- Help during incidents, performance issues, and maintenance;

- Serve as a learning resource for people growing into DBA / SRE roles;

- Encourage knowledge sharing across database technologies;

- Build a practical reference;
